/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Report Card Generator Pro.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes shared data access for all users, allowing all users to access the same data without restrictions. Write access is restricted to prevent unauthorized data modification.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, secured via path-based ownership.
 * - /student_data/{studentDataId}: Stores student data, accessible to all users.
 * - /report_card_settings/{reportCardSettingsId}: Stores report card settings, accessible to all users.
 * - /report_card_history/{reportCardHistoryId}: Stores the history of generated report cards, accessible to all users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All users have read access to the `student_data`, `report_card_settings`, and `report_card_history` collections.
 * - Only authenticated users can read and write to their own user document in `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Write access to the `student_data`, `report_card_settings`, and `report_card_history` collections is explicitly denied.
 * - Data shape validation is relaxed to facilitate rapid prototyping but ownership is enforced.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The design avoids relying on hierarchical authorization or `get()` calls within rules. Instead, all authorization decisions are made based on direct document properties or the request context.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - All documents are placed in root-level collections instead of user subcollections to ensure universal access.

     * @principle Enforces document ownership for writes and restricts access to a user's own data tree.
